# Rule-Based Temperature Control System

This project implements a basic rule-based engine to simulate enterprise-level decision-making for controlling an air conditioner (AC) based on the input temperature. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming in Python to define actions, conditions, and rules that trigger appropriate responses.

## üîß Features

- Define and bind **actions** to temperature-related **conditions**
- A simple `RuleBook` engine to manage and execute rules
- Modular and extendable design to accommodate more conditions or devices

## üìÅ Project Structure

```python
# Actions
